Tema:

Create a payments portal, having two modules or two main routes: /payments and /users
For payments we have the following scenarios
/payments/ (LIST)
/payments/:id (VIEW/EDIT)

 
/users/ (LIST)
/users/:id (VIEW/EDIT)
/users/create (CREATE USER)

 
Each main route should have children routes done with React Router V6
Create Pages for Payments List and Payments Details using an array of payments that have the following model:

interface Payment {
id: string;
price: number;
VAT: number;
totalPrice: number;
products: Product[]
}

interface Product {
id: string;
name: string;
description: string;
price: number;
VAT: number;
totalPrice: number;
}

 

- the array of payments should be stored in a json and delivered with the help of the npm package JSON Server that enables a resource server over an existing JSON file.
- The payments list should be displayed in a Data Grid
- For components (including data grid), use React Material UI package.
